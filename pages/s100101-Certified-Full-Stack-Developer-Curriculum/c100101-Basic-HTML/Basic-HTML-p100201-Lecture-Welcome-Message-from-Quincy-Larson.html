<h2>Welcome Message from Quincy</h2>
<p>In this lecture, Quincy Larson, the founder of freeCodeCamp.org, introduces the Basic HTML
  course and explains what learners can expect.</p>
<p>I'm Quincy Larson, teacher and founder of freeCodeCamp.org.</p>
<p>Our charity's mission is to create free learning resources to help people learn math,
  programming, and computer science. And that's precisely what we've done for you here.</p>
<p>This free, verified certification includes thousands of hours of lectures, interactive 
  labs, and projects. You're going to build dozens of apps from scratch.</p>
<p>This is real coding. Everything's fully interactive. You'll immediately apply concepts 
  as you learn them. And you'll get plenty of practice and spaced repetition along the way.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, tens of thousands of people who've learned to code using freeCodeCamp 
  have gotten their first developer jobs. Many of these people don't even have a university degree.</p>
<p>But I'm not going to sugarcoat it: learning to code is hard. You're going to spend many 
  nights and weekends sharpening your skills by building projects.</p>
<p>The good news is that the freeCodeCamp community is with you all the way. You can get help 
  anytime you get stuck. Just use the freeCodeCamp forum or the freeCodeCamp Discord. Or you can 
  use the search bar and search through thousands of reference articles created by the community.</p>
<p>In the next lecture, I'll explain how the freeCodeCamp curriculum and how the certifications work.</p>

<h2>How Does the Certification Process Work?</h2>
<p>freeCodeCamp offers free, verified certifications. We've structured our curriculum to give you tons
  of practice with each tool and each concept, to help you prepare for your certification exams.</p>
<p>You'll read short lectures and answer comprehension-check questions about them.</p>
<p>You'll code your way through step-by-step interactive workshops.</p>
<p>And you'll build dozens of projects from scratch.</p>
<p>Along the way, you'll pass dozens of quizzes and exams. And you'll prove to us — and you'll prove
  to yourself — that you've mastered these tools and concepts.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the curriculum, you'll build your own unique capstone project that we'll review and
  give you feedback on. This will be a project worthy of adding to your professional portfolio.</p>
<p>After you've completed the curriculum, passed the final exam, and built your capstone project,
  you can claim your free verified certification.</p>
<p>Your certification will have its own unique verification URL, unique serial number, and unique QR code.
  You can add your certification to your résumé, LinkedIn, CV, and portfolio website.</p>
<p>At freeCodeCamp, we take developer education seriously. There are no shortcuts.
  You'll spend thousands of hours completing the curriculum.</p>
<p>Even if life gets in the way, and you have to stop for a while, we'll be here, ready to help you
  push forward with your skills.</p>
<p>You need to work hard, yes. But you also need to work smart.</p>
<p>Before we dive into the curriculum, I'm going to share some insight into how most people learn effectively,
  and how most people work smart.</p>

<section id="lectureTopic">
<h2>How do Most People Learn Effectively?</h2>
<p>Learning is a skill all its own. And I'm going to quickly introduce you to key observations that
  scientists have made about learning.</p>
<p>These come from engineering professor Barbara Oakley's book, <em>Learning how to Learn.</em></p>
<section id="lectureConcept" tabindex="0">
<h3>Concept number 1: Spaced Repetition</h3>
<p>Learning for half an hour each day for a week is much more effective
  than learning for three and a half hours all in one day. This is because of the role that sleep plays in memory.
  When you sleep, your brain builds and reinforces neural structures. With spaced repetition,
  you review concepts regularly — first every few days, then every few weeks, then every few months.
  Each time, your retention of those concepts improves. freeCodeCamp has spaced repetition
  baked right into the curriculum.</p>
</section>
<section id="lectureConcept" tabindex="0">
<h3>Concept number 2: Interleaving Practice</h3>
<p>Rather than just studying one concept for an entire study session,
  it's better to get a little exposure to lots of concepts. This shakes up your brain,
  and forces you to continually reframe what you know. Through interleaving practice,
  you train yourself to be more agile in your thinking. For this reason, the freeCodeCamp curriculum covers
  a ton of ground quickly, then circles back to reinforce everything over and over.</p>
</section>
<section id="lectureConcept" tabindex="0">
<h3>Concept number: Active Recall</h3>
<p>It's easy to trick yourself into thinking you're much better at
  a skill than you actually are. Almost all beginners experience what scientists call
  an "illusion of competence". But, the best way to shatter that illusion is to actively recall
  and apply what you're learning. The freeCodeCamp curriculum does this through quizzes,
  coding exercises, and full-blown projects.</p>
</section>
<p>Again, we've incorporated all of these concepts into the freeCodeCamp curriculum.
  You're welcome to customize your learning as you see fit. But when in doubt, just keep going
  through the curriculum, from top to bottom, and you'll be fine.</p>
<p>In the next lecture, we will discuss some strategies for building effective learning habits.</p>

<h2>How Can You Build Effective Learning Habits and Work Smarter?</h2>
<p>To make it through something as rigorous as the freeCodeCamp curriculum, you'll need to not
  only work hard - you'll need to work smart.</p>
<p>Over the years, I've talked with thousands of people who've learned to code and gotten developer jobs.
  Here are some tips that have worked for them.</p>
<section id="lectureTip" tabindex="0">
<h3>Tip number 1: Pace yourself. </h3>
<p>Learning to code is a marathon, not a sprint. Remember that it's better
  to code 30 minutes every day of the week, than to try and cram all your learning into one day. This
  is thanks to the important role that sleep plays in learning.</p>
<p>The freeCodeCamp curriculum already incorporates all those learning concepts I mentioned earlier:
  spaced repetition, interleaving practice, active recall. All you need to do is sit down and work
  through the curriculum consistently every day.</p>
<p>This is easier said than done. Most people who start this curriculum will at some point stop.
  Hopefully, some of those people will come back and finish in the future. But let's talk about you.
  We want you to finish what you start. And the best advice I have is to remember to pace yourself.</p>
<h3>Tip number 2: Routine is your friend. </h3>
<p>If you make a habit of waking up 30 minutes earlier every day,
  you can get in a coding session before you go to work. After a few weeks of doing this, it just becomes
  part of your routine. You don't really have to think too much about it, or expend any additional willpower.
  It's just something that you do.</p>
<p>Now, I understand that you're probably busy. I wish I could tell you that there was just some magic book
  that you could buy, and that would be enough. The reason buying a book feels so good is that it feels like
  you're also buying the time to read it. But there's no magic involved in learning to code. You've got to
  put in the time. You've got to put in the reps at the keyboard.</p>
<p>I'll tell you this: if you can code for even 30 minutes a day, you're going to make serious gains over
  the course of a year.</p>
<h3>Tip number 3: Use the Pomodoro technique. </h3>
<p>Pomodoro is the Italian word for tomato. In Italy they have
  these tomato shaped clocks that you set for 25 minutes.</p>
<p>Sitting down to code isn't easy. It takes willpower. So to make it easier to sit down and start
  that coding, just tell yourself that you're going to code for 25 minutes. Set a timer. Then, once
  you've finished 25 minutes, you can take a break. But by this point, you may be so deep into your
  coding session, that you don't even need to take a break.</p>
<p>The Pomodoro technique makes it a lot easier to get started.</p>
<h3>Final tip: Remember to get plenty of sleep. </h3>
<p>You'll learn best when you're at your best. Sleep plays a vital role in how your brain learns.
  I encourage you to try to sleep at least 8 hours each night.</p>
<p>And with that, you're ready to dive into the curriculum and start working toward earning your
  freeCodeCamp verified certification. Happy coding!</p>
