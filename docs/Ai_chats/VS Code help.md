# Keep files **permanently open** in the VS Code editor 

To keep files **permanently open** in the VS Code editor (instead of replacing the current one), you’ll want to disable **preview mode**. Here's how to do that:

### 🛠️ Option 1: Disable Preview Mode Globally
1. Open **Settings** (`Ctrl+,` or `Cmd+,` on macOS).
2. Search for: `workbench.editor.enablePreview`
3. Uncheck **"Workbench › Editor: Enable Preview"**

This ensures that files opened from the Explorer or elsewhere will always stay open in a new tab.

### 🖱️ Option 2: Open Files Permanently (One-by-One)
If you don’t want to change the global setting:
- **Double-click** the file in the Explorer instead of single-clicking.
- Or, once the file is open in preview mode (italic tab title), **double-click the tab** to pin it.

### 📌 Bonus Tip: Pin Tabs
You can also **right-click** a tab and choose **"Keep Open"** or **"Pin"** to prevent it from being replaced.

Let me know if you want to customize tab behavior further—like auto-closing unused tabs or grouping by folder.
